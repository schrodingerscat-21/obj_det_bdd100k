*Comprehensive visualization showing class distribution, environmental conditions, and cross-scenario analysis*

## Key Findings

### Critical Issues Identified

1. **Extreme Class Imbalance**
   - Most common class: car (102,506 instances)
   - Rarest class: train (15 instances)
   - Imbalance will significantly impact model performance on rare classes

2. **High Occlusion Rates**
   - Overall average: 61.0% of objects occluded
   - rider: 88.3% occluded
   - bike: 88.1% occluded
   - train: 86.7% occluded

3. **Underrepresented Conditions**
   - Foggy conditions: Only 0.13% of dataset
   - Total challenging conditions: 11.3% of dataset
   - Night + bad weather: 566 images

## Recommendations

### For Model Training

1. **Address Class Imbalance**
   - Implement weighted loss functions or focal loss
   - Use oversampling for rare classes
   - Consider class-balanced sampling strategies

2. **Handle High Occlusion**
   - Use data augmentation with artificial occlusion
   - Implement robust feature extraction methods
   - Consider part-based detection approaches

3. **Improve Robustness to Challenging Conditions**
   - Augment training with synthetic weather effects
   - Use domain adaptation techniques
   - Develop specialized models for night/adverse weather

### For Data Collection

1. Prioritize collection of:
   - Foggy weather conditions
   - Rare object classes (trains, motorcycles)
   - Night + adverse weather combinations
   - Dawn/dusk transition periods
